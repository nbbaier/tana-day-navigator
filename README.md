# tana-day-navigator

This is a simple chrome extension that adds keyboard shortcuts to navigate between day pages in [Tana](https://tana.inc). Currently, the functionality is really limited, the following shortcuts are support:

- `Hyper` (⌃⌥⌘⇧) + `[` to go to the previous day page
- `Hyper` (⌃⌥⌘⇧) + `]` to go to the next day page

Because there is no support for shortcut customization right now, you'll need some way to trigger the hyper key. I'm using [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) for this right now.

# installation 

1. Clone the repo or download the zip and unzip it.
2. Navigative to the Chrome extension manager (`chrome://extensions`) and turn on `Developer mode`.
3. Choose the `Load unpacked` button and open the extracted folder.

# planned enhancements

- [ ] Customize keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Open Tana's `Go to date` menu via the keyboard
